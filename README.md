# Welcome to my GitHUB Laboratory

Hello my name is Pawe≈Ç and I am web developer mainly working on frontend side Angular2+ but also some backend and architecture stuff.

But thats only part of my story In my free time I am working on some indie game projects currently working on framework for creating web browser games (React, Webpack, Typescript, Yeoman, Phaser or PIXI, WEBGL). If you want to startup some web game project there is yeoman generator available [check it here](https://github.com/Xesenix/generator-xes-bdf)

__You will find a lot of code playground repositories in here mostly used for research, experimentation and learning new stuff.__
